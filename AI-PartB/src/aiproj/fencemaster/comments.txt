1. Search Agent 
	- Search Algorithm: Negamax with Alpha Beta Pruning
	- Enhancements: 
		- Move Ordering based on Adjacency as well.

2. Static Evaluation Function
	Feature Set:
	- Heuristical Positioning
		Corner Avoidance since it does not contribute to victory goals.
	- Adjacency
		We always award pieces who try to clump up to 2, more than that, we do 
		not award as it does not mean anything.
		If the adjacency is 2, it might mean, its trying to form a path.
